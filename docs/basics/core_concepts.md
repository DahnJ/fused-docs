# Core concepts

Fused lets teams run Python in the cloud without having to think about infrastructure. It's the glue layer between your most important data and the applications that consume the data.

If you're looking to simplify your life with serverless cloud, these pages will help you understand the patterns and best practices to work with Fused.


## How does it work?

Fused takes your Python code and runs it in the cloud. Fused lets any of your tools run your code and load its output so you can easily move data across your different apps. This enables you to dramatically simplify your architecture and create seamless integrations.

## The UDF

User Defined Functions (UDFs) are the core of Fused. They contain the Python code you want to run. As this diagram shows, the UDF code defines interactions with datasets and data platforms using standard Python libraries. Fused automagically creates a Hosted API endpoint for each of your UDFs. When an app calls the endpoint, Fused runs the UDF code on a serverless machine and returns the function output.

As a glue layer, UDFs are building blocks that integrate with your most important apps and can be assembled into complex workflows in which UDFs call eachother or run in parallel.

![alt text](https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/ecosystem_diagram.png)

A UDF is a python function with the following components:

- [a) `@fused.udf` decorator](/basics/core-concepts/#a-fusedudf-decorator)
- [b) Function declaration](/basics/core-concepts/#b-function-declaration)
- [c) Typed parameters](/basics/core-concepts/#c-typed-parameters)
- [d) Return object](/basics/core-concepts/#d-return-object)




The structure of the API call determines a UDFs execution mode.

### Execution modes (File & Tile)

![alt text](@site/static/img/filetile5.png)

Fused automatically creates an endpoint for all saved Fused UDF. When a client application calls a UDF endpoint, Fused runs a lightweight serverless Python operation and returns the function output. Like an analytical engine, Fused leverages cloud optimized data formats to efficiently load only the fragments of datasets relevant to an operation - based on specified geographic or logical partitions.

Fused can processes datasets of any size and serve them as dynamic vector and raster tilesets. Instead of loading an entire dataset, which is an expensive operation, Fused tile layers load instantly because they operate on a fraction of the dataset - in parallel. Tile-level spatial filtering supercharges UDFs to process only specific spatial areas within a geopartitioned dataset. 


This enables a UDF endpoint to act as a remote `File`, as a one-off task, or to become a dynamic `Tile` endpoint that interoperates with map tiling system.

#### File & Tile

Depending on how a client application calls an endpoint, the same endpoint can run a UDF as a one-off `File` or as a dynamic `Tile`. 

- When an endpoint is called as a `File`, the UDF runs only once and returns a single batch of output data.  This behaves like the access pattern for a remote file URL.
- When and endpoint is called as a `Tile`, the endpoint becomes interoperable with map tiling clients. The endpoint is called and returns data in parallel for each tile - specified by templated `X`, `Y`, and `Z` indices.

Read-on to understand the nuances between the two way UDF endpoints can be called.

#### Call a UDF endpoint as a File

By default, a UDF runs as `File` - it executes once and returns a single output that corresponds to the input parameters. The UDF endpoint behaves like a remote file in that calling it returns a single batch of data - but the endpoint also accepts parameters that dynamically influence the UDF's execution. 

This enables client applications to make an HTTP request and load the UDF's output data into the tool that makes the call.

Note that files are downloaded entirely. Even if the data is requested as a Parquet.

#### Call a UDF endpoint as a Tile

The same UDF's API endpoint can be called to run like a Tile. This makes it possible for Fused to work like a Tile server that loads vector or raster data into industry standard tools that render [tiled web maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) - think Leaflet, Mapbox, Foursquare Studio, Lonboard, and beyond. Tiling clients can make dozens of simultaneous calls to the Fused API endpoint - one for each tile - and seamlessly stitch the outputs to render a map. Instead of operating on an entire dataset, Fused only acts on the data that corresponds to the area visible in the current viewport.

:::tip
You can read more about the XYZ indexing system in the [Deck.gl](http://Deck.gl) [documentation](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/geo-layers/tile-layer#indexing-system). In fact, Fused Workbench runs UDFs on a serverless backend and renders output in Deck.gl.
:::

### a) `@fused.udf` decorator

To create a UDF, decorate a Python function with `@fused.udf`. This decorator automatically the function into a serverless endpoint that can be invoked via HTTP requests and gives it the ability to fractionally load data. 

This simplified example illustrates the concept. It's that simple.

```python
@fused.udf
def my_udf():
    ...
    return gdf
```

### b) Function declaration

The next step is to structure the function's business logic to interact with upstream data sources and return an object which will be the UDF's output.

To illustrate, this UDF is a function called `udf` that returns a dataframe. Notice how its import statements are placed within the function declaration. The `bbox` argument gives the data spatial awareness, which you can read more about [here](/basics/core-concepts/#file--tile).

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox, table_path="s3://fused-asset/infra/building_msft_us"):
    from utils import table_to_tile
    df=table_to_tile(bbox, table=table_path)
    return df
```

:::tip
To visualize the output of a UDF on Workbench, the function should return a Raster or Vector object. Workbench will render the UDF's returned data as a map layer. Read more about return types [here](/basics/core-concepts/#udf-execution-modes-file-tile).
:::

#### Syntax to keep in mind

The Fused compute engine recognizes the UDF as self-contained function. This means that developers should:
- Decorate the UDF function with `@fused.udf`.
- Declare imports within the function.
- Encapsulate helper functions as importable `util modules` of the UDF.
- Optionally, enable autodetection with [explicit typing](/workbench/udf-editor/#auto-tile-and-file).

Thatâ€™s all the new syntax you need to remember to get started!

### c) Typed parameters

HTTP calls to UDF endpoints may specify argument values via [query parameters](https://www.branch.io/glossary/query-parameters/). These must be URL encoded, but Fused needs to know their intended type.

When a UDF's signature have explicit types, Fused resolves arguments to the specified types. 

For example, take a function like this one, with typed parameters.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.Bbox = None, table_path: str = "", n: int=10):
    from utils import table_to_tile
    df=table_to_tile(bbox, table=table_path, n=n)
    return df
```

When its endpoint is called like so, Fused injects a `bbox` parameter corresponding to a Tile with the `1,1,1` index, resolve `table_path` value as a string and the `n` value as an integer.

```bash
curl -XGET "https://app.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/$SHARED_TOKEN/run/tiles/1/1/1?table_path=table.shp&n=4"
```

:::tip
UDF endpoints can be called via HTTP requests, so input parameters must be serializable. 

As such, it's important to explicitly define the types of input parameters. That way, Fused knows to convert serialized parameters to the correct type.  That way, for example, if a parameter is declared as an `int`, a stringified `"42"` will convert to an integer `42`.
:::




#### The `bbox` object

A UDF becomes spatially aware when it leverages the `bbox` parameter to spatially filter the datasets it operates on. A UDF can load from a cloud optimized dataset only the parts of the file that are actually required by the query. 

:::tip
The growing popularity of cloud optimized data formats revolutionized data processing by eliminating the need for specialized hardware to handle large datasets. These datasets organize vector tables and raster arrays in such a way that Fused reads only specified portions of the file. 

By strategically designing your UDFs be spatially aware (with the `bbox` parameter), Fused distributes execution across multiple workers that scale and wind down as needed. 

ðŸ’¡ For further reading on data formats, refer to resources on:

- [Cloud Optimized GeoTiff](https://www.cogeo.org/)
- [Raster](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/rasterio.windows.html)
- [Geoparquet](https://geoparquet.org/)
- [GeoArrow](https://geoarrow.org/format.html)

:::

When writing UDFs, itâ€™s important to strategically use the `bbox` spatial filter to select which parts of a dataset to load. This section shows approaches for different dataset types.

Tile mapping tools call Fused endpoints and dynamically pass an XYZ index for each Tile to render. When a UDF endpoint is called this way - in Tile mode - Fused passes the UDF a `bbox` object as the first parameter. This object is a data structure with information that corresponds to the Tile's bounds and XYZ coordinates. The object is named `bbox` by convention, but it's possible to use a different name as long as its in the first parameter.

For convenience, users can decide the structure of the `bbox` object by setting explicit typing. The 3 available structures are:
- `fused.types.Bbox` is a `shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon` corresponding to the Tile's bounds.
- `fused.types.TileXYZ` is a `mercantile.Tile` object with values for the the `x`, `y`, and `z` Tile indices.
- `fused.types.TileGDF` is a `geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame` with `x`, `y`, `z`, and `geometry` columns.

:::tip
Because a UDF can be called as either File or Tile, Workbench must explicitly know how to render their output. When a UDF is configured as "Auto", Workbench automatically handles the output as Tile if it statically checks that the types `fused.types.TileXYZ`, `fused.types.TileGDF`, or `fused.types.Bbox` are used in the UDF. Otherwise, it assumes File.

Note that the "Auto" setting is specific and applicable only to the Workbench UI. UDFs called via fused-py or HTTP requests run as Tile only if a parameter specifies the Tile geometry. If the UDF is called as a File, Fused passes a `None` value to the first parameter.
:::

This snippet shows an instance of a box object, which is a [shapely.Polygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html) type with the Tile bounding boxâ€™s 4 vertices.

```python
import shapely
bbox = shapely.Polygon([[-121.640625, 37.43997405227058], [-121.640625, 37.718590325588146], [-121.9921875, 37.718590325588146], [-121.9921875, 37.43997405227058], [-121.640625, 37.43997405227058]])
>> POLYGON ((-121.640625 37.43997405227058, -121.640625 37.718590325588146, -121.9921875 37.718590325588146, -121.9921875 37.43997405227058, -121.640625 37.43997405227058))
```

When writing a UDF, Fused recommends setting the `bbox` as the first parameter, and typing it as a `fused.types.Bbox` with a default value of None. This will enable the UDF to run in both as `File` (when `bbox` isnâ€™t necessarily passed) and as a `Tile`. For example:

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.Bbox=None):
    ...
    return ...
```

##### Filter raster files with the `bbox` object

The Fused function `utils.mosaic_tiff` and `pystac-client`'s `catalog.search` illustrate how to use `bbox` to spatially filter a dataset.

For example, function`utils.mosaic_tiff` generates a mosaic image from a list of TIFF files.  `bbox` defines the area of interest within the list of TIFF files set by `tiff_list`.

```python
utils = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/f928ee1/public/common/").utils
data = utils.mosaic_tiff(
            bbox=bbox,
            tiff_list=tiff_list,
            output_shape=(256, 256),
        )
```

As an example, the [LULC_Tile UDF](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/blob/b89a3aab05cb75dab25abb73e4c17490844ab764/public/LULC_Tile_Example/LULC_Tile_Example.py#L21-L27) uses `mosaic_tiff` to create a mosaic from a set of Land Cover tiffs.


:::tip
When returning a raster object that doesnâ€™t have spatial metadata, like a numpy array, a UDF must also return the bbox object to tell Fused where in the globe to place the output raster. For example: 

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(bbox: fused.types.Bbox=None):
    ...
    return np.array([[â€¦], [â€¦]]), bbox
```
:::

##### Filter STAC datasets with the `bbox` object

STAC ([SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec)) datasets can be queried by passing the bounding boxâ€™s bounds (`bbox.bounds`) to the pystac client of the Python [pystac-client](https://pypi.org/project/pystac-client/) library.

```jsx
import pystac_client
from pystac.extensions.eo import EOExtension as eo

catalog = pystac_client.Client.open(
    "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1",
    modifier=planetary_computer.sign_inplace,
)
items = catalog.search(
    collections=[collection],
    bbox=bbox.total_bounds,
).item_collection()
```

### d) Return object

Spatial data provides type information to render it on a map. The Fused Workbench displays data on the map as either vector or raster types. Vectors are polygons typically in the form of a GeoDataFrame, and rasters are pixel arrays typically in the form of numpy arrays, or xarray Datasets or DataArrays.

> ðŸ’¡ Fused expect all returned GeoDataFrame data in `EPSG:4326` - `WGS84` coordinates, using Latitude-Longitude units in decimal degrees.

When writing a UDF, the data type and CRS of its returned object determines how itâ€™ll appear on the map.

#### Vector

Vectors represent real-world features with points, lines, and polygons. Fused accepts the following Vector return types:

- `gpd.GeoDataFrame`
- `pd.DataFrame`
- `gpd.GeoSeries`
- `pd.Series`
- `shapely geometry`

If the CRS of the returned object is not in`EPSG:4326` CRS, Fused will make a best effort to convert it - so itâ€™s preferable if the UDF uses that CRS.

#### Raster

Raster data is comprised of pixels with values, typically arranged in a grid. Rasters can have one or multiple layers.

Fused accepts the following Raster return types

- `numpy.ndarray`
- `xarray.DataArray`
- `datashader.transfer_functions.Image`
- `io.BytesIO` (including png images)

The returned raster object must have a geospatial component. This tells Fused where on the map to render it as an image. For example, this UDF returns an `xarray` `DataArray`, which inherently contains coordinates that tell Fused where on the map to place it. Verify this by printing the object and its type.

```python
import fused
@fused.udf
def udf(lat=-10, lng=30, dataset='general', version='1.5.4'):
    import rioxarray

    lat2= int(lat//10)*10
    lng2 = int(lng//10)*10
    cog_url = f"s3://dataforgood-fb-data/hrsl-cogs/hrsl_{dataset}/v1.5/cog_globallat_{lat2}_lon_{lng2}_{dataset}-v{version}.tif"

    rds = rioxarray.open_rasterio(
        cog_url,
        masked=True,
        overview_level=4
    )

    # Show the output type
    print(type(rds))

    # Inspect the output object
    print(rds)

    return rds
```

The print statements above should display the following in the stdout box, which shows how the layer value and coordinates of the `DataArray` object.

```text
<class 'xarray.core.dataarray.DataArray'>
<xarray.DataArray (band: 1, y: 1126, x: 1126)>
[1267876 values with dtype=float64]
Coordinates:
  * band         (band) int64 1
  * x            (x) float64 30.0 30.01 30.02 30.03 ... 39.97 39.98 39.99 40.0
  * y            (y) float64 -0.0001389 -0.009028 -0.01792 ... -9.991 -10.0
    spatial_ref  int64 0
Attributes:
    AREA_OR_POINT:  Area
    scale_factor:   1.0
    add_offset:     0.0
```

> ðŸ’¡ There's 2 ways to control the transparency of raster images.
>
  1. In RGB images, the color black (0,0,0) is automatically set to full transparency.
  2. If a 4 channel array is passed, i.e. RGBA, the value of the 4th channel is the transparency.

##### Bounds

At this point you might be wondering: what happens when the raster object does not have an inherent spatial attribute?

Objects like numpy *arrays* donâ€™t inherently have a geo attribute. In these cases, the UDF must also return the object's *bounds* to tell Fused where it goes on the map.

The syntax is to return the array and an object containing its bounds, separated by a comma. For simplicity, Fused provides the `array_to_xarray` util function that converts arrays to xarrays with a geo component. This function takes the array as its first argument, and a geo reference (bounds or the `bbox` object) as its second.

```python
@fused.udf
def udf(lat=-10, lng=30, dataset='general', version='1.5.4'):
    import rioxarray

    lat2= int(lat//10)*10
    lng2 = int(lng//10)*10
    cog_url = f"s3://dataforgood-fb-data/hrsl-cogs/hrsl_{dataset}/v1.5/cog_globallat_{lat2}_lon_{lng2}_{dataset}-v{version}.tif"

    rds = rioxarray.open_rasterio(
        cog_url,
        masked=True,
        overview_level=4
    )

    ...

    # Array values
    output_object = rds.values.squeeze().astype(float)
    object_bounds = rds.rio.bounds()

    # Show outpu object and its bounds
    print(output_object)
    print(object_bounds)

    # Return array and bounds
    return output_object, object_bounds
```


<!--
TODO: reinstate once array_to_xarray relocation consistent
    # Option B: convert to xarray and return
    from fused.utils import array_to_xarray

    output_object_xarray = array_to_xarray(
      rds.values.squeeze().astype(float),
      rds.rio.bounds()
    ) -->

> ðŸ’¡ If you forget to pass the bounds, Fused will default its bounds to `(-180, -90, 180, 90)` and the output image will expand to the size of the globe.
