# DuckDB

This notebook tutorial is support material for the "DuckDB + Fused: Fly beyond the
serverless horizon" blog post.

## 1. Run DuckDB in a Fused UDF

As an example of running DuckDB within a Fused UDF, take the case of loading a
geospatial Parquet dataset. The "DuckDB H3" sample UDF runs an SQL query with DuckDB on
the NYC Taxi Trip Record Dataset. It uses the bbox argument to spatially filter the
dataset and automatically parallelize the operation.

To try this example, you can run the cell below. You can find the code of the UDF in the
Fused public UDF
[repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/DuckDB_H3_Example_Tile).

Alternatively, you can import the "DuckDB H3 Example Tile" UDF into your Fused Workbench
environment.

This pattern gives DuckDB easy parallel operations. Fused spatially filters via the bbox
parameter to enable automatic parallelization. Fused breaks down operations to only a
fraction of the dataset, so it's easy to transition between SQL and Python.

```python
# !pip install fused 
```

```python
import fused

udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/DuckDB_H3_Example_Tile")
gdf = fused.run(udf=udf, x=2412, y=3078, z=13)
gdf
```

## 2. Call Fused UDFs from DuckDB

Any database that supports querying data via HTTP can call and load data from Fused UDF
endpoints using common formats like Parquet or CSV. This means that DuckDB can dispatch
operations to Fused that otherwise would be too complex or impossible to express with
SQL, or would be unsupported in the local runtime.

As an example of calling a Fused endpoint from within DuckDB, take an operation to
vectorize a raster dataset. This might be necessary to determine the bounds of areas
with pixel value within a certain threshold range in an Earth observation image - such
as a Digital Elevation Model. SQL is not geared to support raster operations, but these
are easy to do in Python.

In this example, a Fused UDF returns a table where each record is a polygon generated
from the contour of a raster provided by the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model as a
Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF. DuckDB can easily trigger a UDF and load its output with this
simple query, which specifies that the UDF endpoint returns a Parquet file.

This SQL query uses DuckDB's read_parquet function to call an endpoint of a UDF instance
of the "DEM Raster to Vector" UDF.

You can find the code of the UDF in the Fused public UDF
[repo](https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/DEM_Raster_to_Vector_Example).

To try this example, simply run the following SQL query on the cell below or in a
[DuckDB shell](<https://shell.duckdb.org/#queries=v0,CREATE-TABLE-dem_polygons-AS%0ASELECT-wkt,-area%0AFROM-read_csv('https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime%20shared/'-%7C%7C%0A----'1e35c9b9cadf900265443073b0bd99072f859b8beddb72a45e701fb5bcde807d'-%7C%7C%0A----'/run/file?dtype_out_vector=csv'-%7C%7C%0A----'&min_elevation=500')~%0A>).
Change the `min_elevation` parameter to run the UDF for parts of California at different
elevations. (Note: for DuckDB WASM, the file will be requested as CSV.)

```python
import duckdb

con = duckdb.connect()

con.sql("""
    SELECT 
        wkt, 
        ROUND(area,1) AS area
    FROM read_parquet('https://www.fused.io/server/v1/realtime-shared/1e35c9b9cadf900265443073b0bd99072f859b8beddb72a45e701fb5bcde807d/run/file?min_elevation=500&dtype_out_vector=parquet')
    LIMIT 5
""")

```

This pattern enables DuckDB to address use cases and data formats that it doesn't
natively support or would otherwise see high data transfer cost, such as raster
operations, API calls, and control flow logic.

## 3. Integrate DuckDB in applications using Fused

Fused is the glue layer between DuckDB and apps. This enables seamless integrations that
trigger Fused UDFs and load their results with simple parameterized HTTP calls.

DuckDB is an embedded database engine and doesn't have built-in capability to share
results other than writing out files. As a corollary of the preceding example, it's
possible to query and transform data with DuckDB and seamlessly integrate the results of
queries into any workflow or app.

As an example, take the case of loading the output of a DuckDB query into Google Sheets.
Sheets can easily structure the Fused UDF endpoint to pass parameters defined in
specific cells as URL query parameters. In this example, the importData command calls
the same UDF from above and loads its output data in CSV format.

<img src="https://fused-magic.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs_assets/gifs/sheets.gif" alt="overture" width="600"/>

To try this example simply make a copy of this Google Sheets spreadsheet (File > Make a
copy) and click, and modify the parameters in B2:4 to trigger the Fused UDF endpoint and
load data.

You can learn more about the Google Sheets integration in the
[documentation](/basics/out/googlesheets/).

This pattern brings the power of the DuckDB analytical engine into non-analytical and
no-code software like Google Sheets, Retool, and beyond - without the need to build
bespoke integrations with closed-source systems. With this, a Python developer can
abstract away the UDF and deliver data to end users. This removes the need to even
install DuckDB.

```python
import fused

udf = fused.load("https://github.com/fusedio/udfs/tree/main/public/DuckDB_H3_Example")
gdf = fused.run(udf=udf, engine='realtime')
gdf
```
