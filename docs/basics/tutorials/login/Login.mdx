# Notebook Login

To use the Fused Python SDK within a Python environment, you'll need to authenticate to
interact with the API and run UDFs.

```python
# !pip install fused -q
```

When running code on a local machine, authentication will happen automatically whenever
you start calling fused functions. If no credentials have already been saved to disk,
when you run import fused, you'll see a message describing how to login.

If credentials haven't yet been saved to your local machine (in `~/.fused/credentials`),
this will open up your web browser so you can log in. After the first login, credentials
will be saved and automatically loaded as needed.

The second line will print out a link for you to click on. That link will navigate you
to our login page. After logging in, you'll see

```python
from fused import NotebookCredentials

credentials = NotebookCredentials()
```

Please open this link to authenticate with Fused:

- [https://....us.auth0.com/authorize?audience=fused-python-api&scope=openid+email+name+offline_access&response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fused.io%2Fnotebook_login_redirect&code_challenge_method=S256&code_challenge=...](https://dev-tjcykxcetrz6bps6.us.auth0.com/authorize?audience=fused-python-api&scope=openid+email+name+offline_access&response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fused.io%2Fnotebook_login_redirect&code_challenge_method=S256&code_challenge=...)

Once you have logged in, that page will give you a code which you can paste into this
notebook to finish logging in.


```python
# Paste the credentials snippet found in the URL above
credentials.finalize(code="...")
```

Now the api object will have access to the Fused API.

Note: When running code on a remote machine, the above command-line method won't work
because the remote command line is unable to open a web browser. For those cases, you
can copy the `~/.fused/credentials` file to the target system.

```python

```
