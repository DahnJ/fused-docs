### **1. Introduction: Simplified Vegetation Analysis at Scale**



In today's world, accurate and scalable vegetation analysis is crucial for various industries, including environmental monitoring, forestry management, and urban planning. While machine learning and AI have advanced image analysis, they can be complex and resource-intensive, making them less feasible for large-scale, real-time applications.



Our approach leverages classical computer vision techniques for vegetation segmentation, offering straightforward, transparent analysis that can be applied globally. This UDF enables real-time processing of satellite imagery tiles from services like the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, making it possible to efficiently analyze vast geographic areas without the need for sophisticated AI models.



Traditionally, vegetation analysis is performed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which requires near-infrared (NIR) bands. However, acquiring NIR data at a global scale can be challenging. In contrast, the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) can be calculated using standard RGB bands, making it a practical alternative for large-scale surveys using widely available imagery. This UDF simplifies the process while giving users full control over parameters and workflow, making it an ideal choice for large-scale applications where simplicity, scalability, and transparency are key.



Whether you're monitoring forest health, assessing urban green spaces, or managing natural resources, this UDF provides a reliable and accessible tool for your vegetation analysis needs.



### **2. The Challenge: Efficiently Scaling Classical Computer Vision**



When working with global satellite imagery, the challenge is twofold: achieving accurate segmentation without relying on AI and scaling the process to handle vast geographic areas. AI models, while powerful, can be resource-intensive and complex, making them less suitable for large-scale, real-time analysis.



Our approach focuses on maintaining simplicity while scaling up. By using classical computer vision methods, we eliminate the need for machine learning, allowing for transparent, user-defined parameters that can be easily adjusted for different regions or conditions.



However, scaling this approach to a global level presents unique challenges. The sheer volume of data, varying resolutions, and the need for rapid processing all demand a solution that can handle these factors efficiently. This is where our UDF comes in, capable of integrating with various map servers, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, to dynamically fetch and process satellite imagery tiles in real-time.



By leveraging these services, our UDF can conduct vegetation analysis across the world. This method simplifies the segmentation process and ensures that it can be applied effectively on a global scale, making it an invaluable tool for industries and applications that require large-scale environmental monitoring.



### **3. The Solution: Global Vegetation Masking with Fused.io**



To address the challenge of scalable vegetation analysis, we’ve developed a UDF that leverages classical computer vision methods to segment vegetation from satellite imagery. The UDF can integrate with various global satellite imagery services, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, to dynamically access high-resolution imagery in real-time. This flexibility allows users to apply vegetation segmentation across large geographic areas efficiently.



The UDF processes each tile by extracting color bands, calculating a vegetation index like VARI, and applying user-defined thresholds and morphological operations. This approach ensures accurate, scalable vegetation analysis without the need for complex machine learning models.



Fused.io’s serverless infrastructure further enhances this solution by providing the necessary computational power to handle large-scale data processing without the overhead of managing servers or resources. This combination of classical computer vision methods and scalable cloud infrastructure enables real-time, global vegetation analysis, making it ideal for applications that require extensive geographic coverage with transparent and easily adjustable processing steps.



### **4. Key Benefits**



Our UDF provides a powerful solution for scalable vegetation analysis, combining simplicity, transparency, and global reach:



- **Global Scale, No AI Needed**: Unlike complex AI-driven methods, our UDF uses straightforward, classical computer vision techniques that scale effortlessly across vast geographic areas. This makes it possible to conduct large-scale vegetation analysis without the need for machine learning models.



- **Transparency and Efficiency**: The UDF’s workflow is fully transparent, allowing users to understand and adjust each step of the process. This simplicity ensures that the method is both easy to implement and cost-effective, avoiding the resource-heavy demands of AI-based approaches.



- **Broad Applicability**: The UDF can be applied globally using various satellite imagery sources, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer, making it ideal for industries that require extensive environmental monitoring, such as forestry and urban planning. The ability to process satellite imagery in real-time means that users can quickly gain insights across diverse regions, enabling timely decision-making and resource management.



### **5. Technical Deep Dive: How the Scalable UDF Works**



The UDF is designed to perform classical computer vision-based vegetation segmentation at a global scale, using satellite imagery tiles fetched from various map servers, such as the ArcGIS World Imagery MapServer. Here’s how it works:



- **Input Parameters for Global Scale**: The UDF takes user-defined parameters, such as the bounding box coordinates (x, y, z), to dynamically retrieve satellite imagery tiles. Users can also adjust parameters like kernel size and threshold values to customize the segmentation process.



- **Classical Computer Vision Segmentation Steps**:

  1. **Band Extraction**: The UDF extracts the blue, green, and red bands from the satellite image, which are essential for calculating vegetation indices.

  2. **Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) Calculation**: Using the zoom level, the UDF calculates the GSD, which determines the spatial resolution of the imagery.

  3. **Vegetation Index Calculation (VARI)**: The UDF computes the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), a simple yet effective index for identifying vegetation by comparing the green, red, and blue bands. Unlike NDVI, which requires NIR bands, VARI can be calculated using standard RGB data, making it more accessible for large-scale surveys.

  4. **Thresholding**: A user-defined or default threshold is applied to the VARI to create a binary mask, marking pixels as vegetation or non-vegetation.

  5. **Smoothing and Morphological Operations**: To refine the mask, the UDF optionally applies Gaussian smoothing and morphological operations like opening and closing, which help remove noise and improve segmentation accuracy.



- **Output for Global Application**: The final output is a binary vegetation mask, where vegetation is highlighted across the satellite imagery tile. This output can be used for various large-scale applications, from monitoring deforestation to managing urban green spaces.



This technical approach ensures that the UDF remains simple, flexible, and scalable, making it an effective tool for global vegetation analysis without the need for complex machine learning models.



### **6. Use Cases and Applications**

- **Forestry Management**: This UDF is particularly useful for forestry applications, such as monitoring forest health and identifying areas of vegetation stress or detecting dead or dying trees. Forestry managers can use this tool to track forest conditions on a large scale, helping to detect early signs of disease, pests, or environmental stressors. This supports efforts in forest conservation, reforestation, and the sustainable management of forest resources.



- **Urban Planning and Green Space Management**: City planners can apply this UDF to monitor and manage urban green spaces, ensuring sustainable urban development and maintaining the ecological balance within cities.
